This is a CHIP-8 Emulator.

To run the emulator, you need to run the .exe file with 3 (1 mandatory, 2 optional) arguments:
<path>: this is the absolute path to the object, should be inputted as a string.
<scale_factor>: scales the screen from default resolution (64x32) to fit your screen (20 is the default value)
<cycle_delay>: scales the refresh rate to run faster or slower (1 is the default value)
